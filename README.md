# Computational Mathematics
Personal collection of computational mathematics routines in Python. 

Current available routines:

# Optimization
1) GBT - Deterministic gradient descent algorithm.
2) Newton's Method - Classic Newton's direction descent algorithm.
3) BFGS - Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm.

All of the above methods are equipped with backtracking line search.
